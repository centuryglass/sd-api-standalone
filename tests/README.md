# Backend integration tests

Live-API integration tests for the two backend clients:

- `sd_backend_client.api.a1111_webservice.A1111Webservice` (A1111 / Forge / reForge / Forge Neo)
- `sd_backend_client.api.comfyui_webservice.ComfyUiWebservice` (ComfyUI)

They talk to a **real, running** server rather than mocking HTTP. Point the suite at
whichever backend is up — the other backend's tests skip themselves automatically, so
`pytest tests/` is safe with only one (or neither) running.

## Requirements

- A running A1111/Forge/reForge/Forge Neo WebUI (`--api` enabled) **and/or** a running ComfyUI.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` plus `pytest`.

## Environment

| Variable         | Default                  | Purpose                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `SD_API_URL`     | `http://127.0.0.1:7860`  | A1111 base URL (overrides host+port).          |
| `SD_API_PORT`    | `7860`                   | A1111 port only, when `SD_API_URL` is unset.   |
| `SD_UNAME`       | —                        | A1111 username, if the server uses `--api-auth`.|
| `SD_PASS`        | —                        | A1111 password, if the server uses `--api-auth`.|
| `COMFYUI_API_URL`| `http://127.0.0.1:8188`  | ComfyUI base URL (overrides host+port).        |
| `COMFYUI_API_PORT`| `8188`                  | ComfyUI port only, when `COMFYUI_API_URL` unset.|
| `SD_TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` | `tests/output/`      | Where generation tests save PNGs for inspection.|

(ComfyUI has no authentication, so there is no ComfyUI equivalent of `SD_UNAME`/`SD_PASS`.)

## Running

```bash
# Pure-logic unit tests only (no server, no GPU — always runnable, e.g. in CI):
pytest tests/unit/

# Fast, read-only metadata + auth tests for whichever backend(s) are up (+ unit tests):
pytest tests/

# Include the slow generation tests (real diffusion; needs a checkpoint loaded):
pytest tests/ --run-generation
# or
RUN_SD_GENERATION=1 pytest tests/
```

## Unit tests (`tests/unit/`)

Backend-independent tests of the pure "functional core": the code that turns parameters
into request bodies / node graphs, plus serialization and the image/geometry helpers. They
need **no running server** and no GPU, are deterministic, and drive the builders by setting
attributes directly.

- **`test_comfy_workflow_builder.py`** — `DiffusionWorkflowBuilder.build_workflow()` graph
  structure (checkpoint/KSampler params, prompt encoding, txt2img vs img2img latent source,
  CLIP-skip insertion, batch validation).
- **`test_diffusion_request_body.py`** — `DiffusionRequestBody.to_dict()` None-stripping and
  field passthrough.
- **`test_controlnet_serialization.py`** — `ControlNetUnit` / preprocessor serialize↔deserialize
  round-trips (both WebUI and ComfyUI key formats).
- **`test_image_and_geometry.py`** — base64/PNG round-trips, RGBA normalization, `Size`.
- **`test_param_parity.py`** - the same `DiffusionParams` serialized for both backends asks for the same
  generation: sampler and scheduler names, size, batch size, denoising strength and checkpoint.

These pin behavior ahead of the planned config-decoupling refactor: they cover exactly the
logic that survives it, so a regression that silently changes an emitted request will fail
here (fast, offline) rather than only showing up in a live generation.

### Recorded responses (`tests/unit/fixtures/recorded/`)

`test_recorded_responses.py` replays real server responses through the clients' public
methods: ComfyUI's `/object_info`, `/history`, `/queue` and `/system_stats`, and the WebUI's
ControlNet and option-list endpoints. Each `<label>.json` there is written by
`scripts/capture_fixtures.py`, which runs the clients against live servers (the same
`COMFYUI_API_URL`, `SD_API_URL`, `SD_UNAME`/`SD_PASS` variables as the integration tests) and
records every response they read:

```bash
python scripts/capture_fixtures.py                          # every reachable backend
python scripts/capture_fixtures.py --only webui --label a1111
```

There is one WebUI recording per fork: `a1111`, `forge`, `reforge` and `forge_neo`. Each
recording's `meta.capabilities` holds what `get_capabilities()` reported live, and the replay
checks the client derives the same from the recorded responses. The forks differ in which
routes they serve: the Forge forks have no `/controlnet/version` or `/controlnet/settings`,
and Forge Neo also drops `/sdapi/v1/hypernetworks` and `/sdapi/v1/interrogate`.

The ComfyUI capture queues one small txt2img job, so it needs a checkpoint. Recordings list
the server's model names, so review them before committing. When a client change requests an
endpoint a recording lacks, the replay fails and names it; re-run the capture to refresh.

## What's covered (integration)

### A1111 / Forge / reForge / Forge Neo

- **`test_a1111_metadata.py`** — read-only `get_*` accessors (config, samplers,
  upscalers, models, VAE with Forge fallback, LoRAs, hypernetworks, styles, scripts,
  progress, checkpoint refresh).
- **`test_a1111_auth.py`** — `/login` flow and the `credentials_provider` callback.
  Auto-detects whether the server enforces `--api-auth` (`auth_enforced` fixture) and
  asserts the right outcome either way.
- **`test_a1111_controlnet.py`** — ControlNet extension endpoints. Gated on
  `/controlnet/model_list` (the reliable "installed" signal); the fork-specific optional
  routes `/controlnet/version` and `/controlnet/settings` skip individually if a build
  (e.g. reForge) drops them.
- **`test_a1111_generation.py`** *(opt-in)* — real round-trips: txt2img (single/batch,
  seed echo), img2img, inpaint-with-mask, basic upscale, interrogate (skipped where the
  server has no `/sdapi/v1/interrogate`), interrupt.
- **`test_a1111_controlnet_generation.py`** *(opt-in)* — ControlNet diffusion. Includes a
  **silent-failure detector**: the same seed + prompt is generated with and without a
  control unit, and the test fails unless the two images actually differ.

### ComfyUI

ComfyUI's API is asynchronous and workflow-based (jobs are queued by `prompt_id` and
polled to completion); `comfy_helpers.py` wraps that lifecycle and the cache setup the
workflow builders read from.

- **`test_comfyui_metadata.py`** — read-only accessors (system stats, model types,
  checkpoints, VAE/LoRA/ControlNet/hypernetwork/upscale models, embeddings, extensions,
  sampler & scheduler names, `is_node_available`, queue info).
- **`test_comfyui_generation.py`** *(opt-in)* — real round-trips: txt2img (seed echo),
  img2img, inpaint-with-mask, upscale, interrupt.
- **`test_comfyui_controlnet_generation.py`** *(opt-in)* — Canny preprocessor preview
  plus the same **silent-failure detector** A/B (with vs. without a control unit).

### Both backends

- **`test_shared_params.py`** - each server lists the names in `sampler_names`' tables (unlisted ones are
  warnings); *(opt-in)* img2img resizes a source to `width` x `height` on both backends, and WebUI applies the
  requested scheduler.

## Reviewing saved outputs

The generation tests save their images to the output dir (default `tests/output/`, git-ignored). No test checks
that an image matches its prompt, so after a `--run-generation` run, review the images against this checklist.

- Each test overwrites its own files. A file older than the rest came from a skipped test or from a test that no
  longer exists.
- Files with the `comfy_` prefix come from ComfyUI. All others come from WebUI.
- Generated images are small and use few steps, so soft, low-detail output is expected. Judge whether each image
  follows its prompt and inputs, not its quality.
- Inputs (`*_source`, `*_mask`, `*_input`) are drawn by `helpers.py` and are the same on every run. A change in one
  points to the test helpers, not the backend.

Every generated image:

- [ ] Is not solid black, solid gray or pure noise. Any of these points to a VAE, sampler or decode failure.
- [ ] Has no transparent or checkerboard areas.
- [ ] Has natural colors, not inverted or channel-swapped (for example, a red apple that comes out blue).

### WebUI

From `test_a1111_generation.py`, `test_a1111_async.py` and `test_shared_params.py`. Except where noted, images are
256x256 at 4 steps.

- [ ] `txt2img.png`: a red apple on a wooden table.
- [ ] `txt2img_batch_0.png`, `txt2img_batch_1.png`: two apple-on-table images that differ from each other. Two
  identical images mean the batch reused one seed.
- [ ] `img2img_result.png`: a landscape painting, clearly changed from `img2img_source.png` (a diagonal color
  gradient with a white square outline and a black circle outline). Traces of the source's colors or framing may
  remain at 0.75 denoise.
- [ ] `inpaint_result.png`: a flower fills the center square, which `inpaint_mask.png` marks white.
- [ ] Outside the center square of `inpaint_result.png`, the gradient and white square outline match
  `inpaint_source.png` pixel for pixel, with a crisp boundary (`mask_blur=0`). A changed border around an untouched
  center means the mask was inverted.
- [ ] `upscale_result.png`: `upscale_source.png` at 256x256, with the same composition and no added content.
- [ ] `async_txt2img.png` (512x512, 20 steps, as are the other `async_*` images): a red apple on a wooden table.
- [ ] `async_img2img.png`: an oil-painting look in blue-dominant colors, from a flat blue source.
- [ ] `async_serialize_1.png` is a blue teapot and `async_serialize_2.png` is a green frog. Swapped or identical
  subjects mean the two queued jobs' results were mixed up.
- [ ] `async_idle_wait.png`: a small red cube. A fantasy landscape here is the other client's job, not ours.
- [ ] `shared_params_webui_img2img.png`: a 256x320 portrait watercolor from a 192x128 landscape source, filling the
  frame without stretching or letterbox bars.

### ComfyUI

From `test_comfyui_generation.py`, `test_comfyui_async.py` and `test_shared_params.py`. Except where noted, images
are 256x256 at 8 steps.

- [ ] `comfy_txt2img.png`: a red apple on a wooden table.
- [ ] `comfy_img2img_result.png`: a vivid landscape painting, clearly changed from `comfy_img2img_source.png`.
- [ ] `comfy_inpaint_result.png`: flower-like content replaces the center square that `comfy_inpaint_mask.png`
  marks white.
- [ ] Outside the center square of `comfy_inpaint_result.png`, the gradient and white square outline survive. Slight
  softening is normal, because ComfyUI passes the whole image through the VAE. An edited border around an untouched
  center means `ComfyUiWebservice.upload_mask` converted the mask polarity wrong.
- [ ] `comfy_upscale_result.png`: `comfy_upscale_source.png` at 256x256, sharper than a plain resize, with no new
  content. It is missing when the server has no upscale model installed.
- [ ] `comfy_async_txt2img.png`: identical to `comfy_txt2img.png`, since both use the same prompt, seed, size and
  steps. A visible difference means the async path builds a different workflow.
- [ ] `comfy_async_img2img.png`: an oil-painting look in blue-dominant colors, from a flat blue source.
- [ ] `comfy_async_queue_1.png` is a blue teapot and `comfy_async_queue_2.png` is a green frog. Swapped or identical
  subjects mean a handle downloaded another prompt's outputs.
- [ ] `comfy_async_running_survived_cancel.png`: a fully rendered 512x512 fantasy landscape. A half-finished, noisy
  or missing image means cancelling the queued job interrupted the running one. A red cube is the cancelled job.
- [ ] `comfy_async_targeted_interrupt.png`: a fully rendered 512x512 fantasy landscape. A half-finished or noisy
  image means the server ignored the prompt id in `/interrupt` and stopped the wrong job.
- [ ] `shared_params_comfyui_img2img.png`: a 256x320 portrait watercolor filling the frame without stretching.
  Expect a similar style to the WebUI version, not the same image.

### ControlNet

ControlNet can fail silently: the server returns a normal image and ignores the control unit. Each backend's suite
generates "a photograph of a city street, detailed" with seed 42, once without ControlNet and once with Canny.

- [ ] `controlnet_input.png` and `comfy_controlnet_input.png`: identical black lines on white, a square outline, a
  centered circle and both corner-to-corner diagonals.
- [ ] `controlnet_preview_canny.png` and `comfy_controlnet_preview_CannyEdgePreprocessor.png`: thin white edge lines
  on black tracing the same shapes, with each thick input line doubled. They are 512x512, the preprocessors'
  default resolution, though the input is 256x256.
- [ ] `controlnet_baseline_no_cn.png` and `comfy_controlnet_baseline_no_cn.png`: a loose street scene with no
  visible square or circle structure.
- [ ] `controlnet_with_canny.png` and `comfy_controlnet_with_CannyEdgePreprocessor.png`: the composition follows
  the edge map, with the square frame, central circle and diagonals plainly visible, typically as a corridor or
  room seen head-on. The test only asserts a mean difference of 2/255 from the baseline, which a weak or partly
  applied unit can pass.

### What the tests already assert

| Image group | Asserted automatically | Left to the reviewer |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| All generated images | RGBA, size within 8 px of target | Prompt adherence; black, noise or color-swap output |
| img2img | Mean difference from source >= 10/255 | Style matches the prompt |
| Inpainting | Center changes >= 20/255. WebUI border <= 5/255; ComfyUI center change >= 3x border change | Seam quality; the fill is a flower |
| Upscale | At least 200 px on each side | No added content or artifacts |
| ControlNet pair | Mean difference >= 2/255 | The edge structure shapes the image |
| Preprocessor preview | Not a single flat color | Edges match the input shapes |
| Async queue and cancel | Status sequence; both images returned | Each image matches its own prompt |
| Shared params img2img | 256x320 size; WebUI reports DPM++ 2M with Karras | No stretching or distortion |

## Graceful degradation

The suite is designed to stay green across environments: it **skips** (never errors)
when the server is unreachable, when auth is disabled, when ControlNet is absent, or
when the generation flag is off.
