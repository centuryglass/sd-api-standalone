"""WebUI (A1111 / Forge) implementation of the backend-agnostic generation handle.

The WebUI's ``txt2img`` / ``img2img`` HTTP calls block until the image is ready, and the server has no
endpoint to drop a *specific* queued job — only to interrupt the one currently running. Naively firing
the blocking POST on a background thread therefore gives you a job you cannot cleanly cancel: killing the
client thread (by closing its socket) leaves the server diffusing the image anyway, because Starlette
runs the sync endpoint to completion regardless of client disconnect.

So instead of pushing work to the server immediately, this module keeps a **client-side single-slot
dispatch queue** (:class:`WebUIDispatcher`). A submitted job sits in that queue, unsent, until the
dispatcher's worker thread pulls it and fires the blocking POST — and only then, ideally once the server
is idle. The upshot:

- While a job is client-queued (``PENDING``) it hasn't touched the network, so cancelling it is instant
  and clean: drop it from the queue, done. No orphaned GPU work.
- Once dispatched (``ACTIVE``) ``cancel()`` maps to the server's ``/sdapi/v1/interrupt``.

This lifts the WebUI up to the same inspectable/cancellable-queue capability ComfyUI has natively,
instead of dragging the unified interface down to the WebUI's lowest common denominator. The only thing
given up is the server's own FIFO fairness when *multiple* clients share one instance — an accepted
trade-off for the single-client scripting use case this wrapper targets.

Every ``force_task_id`` is threaded into the request body so the dispatched job can later be correlated
with the server's ``/internal/progress`` view if finer-grained queue tracking is added.
