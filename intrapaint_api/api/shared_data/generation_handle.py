"""Backend-agnostic handle for a single in-flight image-generation job.

This is the seam that hides the sync/async discrepancy between the two backends. ComfyUI is natively
asynchronous (submit returns a queue ticket; you poll/stream for progress and download results later),
while the WebUI's HTTP call blocks until the image is ready. Both are modeled here as the *same* thing:
an async submission that yields a :class:`GenerationHandle`.

The design principle is **async is the primitive, blocking is derived**. A backend implements the three
abstract members below (``poll``, ``_build_result``, ``cancel``); the blocking ``wait()`` convenience is
provided here once, in terms of ``poll()``, so every backend gets a correct blocking path for free.

- ComfyUI: ``poll()`` wraps ``check_queue_entry``; ``_build_result()`` downloads the finished image refs.
- WebUI:   the blocking POST runs on a background thread (see ``webui_generation_handle``); ``poll()``
           reports thread state + server progress, and ``_build_result()`` returns the images the thread
           already produced.

No Qt / numpy / cv2 here: previews and results are plain ``PIL.Image`` (per the repo's hard constraints).
