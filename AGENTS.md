# AGENTS.md

Rules for coding agents working in the sd-backend-client codebase. Human-facing setup and usage docs are in
[`README.md`](README.md) and [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md). Open work lives in
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/centuryglass/sd-backend-client/issues); see "Tracking open work".

## How to use this file

- **This file is for facts that cross files, and most changes add nothing to it.** A bullet here earns its place by
  biting someone who is editing a *different* file than the one the fact lives in. Before adding one, ask:
  - Is it relevant only within one file?
  - Would opening that file to make the edit surface it anyway?
  - Would a reader be better served finding it there?

  A yes to any of these means the fact goes in that file's own comment (confirm it is there, or add it). Here it gets
  at most a one-line pointer.
- **Edit by replacing, not appending.** When a change makes a bullet wrong, rewrite that bullet; don't add a second one
  that corrects the first. When the code a bullet describes is gone, delete the bullet.
- **Code comments cite headings and bold lead phrases by file and name** (`AGENTS.md, "Tracking open work"`). Renaming
  one, or moving it to another file, breaks those pointers: grep the repo for the old phrase and fix every hit in the
  same change.
- **Area hazards move to `doc/agents/` once they outgrow this file.** When one area (the ComfyUI node graph, a
  backend client, ControlNet serialization) collects hazards that only matter to edits in that area, move them to
  `doc/agents/<area>.md` and route to it from a "Things that will bite you" table here, listing the paths each file
  covers.
- **`CLAUDE.md` imports this file** with `@AGENTS.md`, so agents that read either name get the same rules. Edit
  `AGENTS.md`.

## What this is

`sd_backend_client` is a standalone, headless Stable Diffusion backend client extracted from
[IntraPaint](https://github.com/centuryglass/IntraPaint)'s `src/api`. It talks to **ComfyUI**, **Forge/Automatic1111
WebUI**, and their **ControlNet** extensions, building the request bodies and node graphs each backend expects.
Everything lives under the `sd_backend_client` package and imports only from within it plus third-party libraries.
Python **3.11+** (see "Conventions").

Status: under active refactoring. Core txt2img / img2img / inpainting / ControlNet paths work end-to-end on both
backends; the ComfyUI node classes' pydantic migration and tiled upscaling are still in progress.

## Who it serves

In priority order:

1. **Library users.** People who install `sd_backend_client` into their own projects. They see the package only through
   its public API, the README and its errors. Keep the README's usage examples working, mark any change that breaks
   the public API (see "Working with GitHub"), and make errors say what went wrong and what to do.
2. **The maintainer.** The package is the maintainer's backend client for IntraPaint and other projects. A change that
   makes it harder to drive either backend from those projects needs a strong reason.
3. **The portfolio.** The repo shows a library extracted from a larger hand-built project and brought up to
   professional standards with coding agents. The reader is a reviewer or hiring manager skimming the repo, looking
   for CI that gates merges, tests that would catch a real regression, honest docs and a clean issue history.

- When a change trades one audience against another, flag the tension to the maintainer. Don't quietly resolve it
  in either direction.
- A process or documentation gap that matters only for portfolio value gets its own GitHub issue, not bundled
  invisibly into unrelated work.

## Running

```bash
pip install -e .                    # the package and its runtime dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # for development: adds pytest and pylint

# Offline pure-logic unit tests: no server, no GPU, deterministic (use these by default):
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/unit/test_comfy_workflow_builder.py::TEST_NAME   # single test

# Live integration tests against whatever backend(s) are up; the rest skip themselves:
pytest tests/                     # fast read-only metadata/auth tests + unit tests
pytest tests/ --run-generation    # add slow real-diffusion round-trips (needs a loaded checkpoint)
RUN_SD_GENERATION=1 pytest tests/ # equivalent env-var form
```

- Point the integration tests at servers via env vars (defaults in parentheses): `SD_API_URL`
  (`http://127.0.0.1:7860`), `COMFYUI_API_URL` (`http://127.0.0.1:8188`), `SD_UNAME`/`SD_PASS` for A1111
  `--api-auth`. `tests/local.env` (gitignored) is a convenience `source`-able file for credentials. `tests/README.md`
  has the full matrix.
- Runtime dependencies are listed with lower bounds only, in both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`; keep the
  two lists in sync. CI's `test-minimum-deps` job runs the tests with every floor installed, so raise a floor when new
  code needs a newer release. Dev tools are pinned exactly in `requirements-dev.txt`, and Dependabot proposes their bumps
  (`.github/dependabot.yml`).

## Architecture

The package is a **functional core / imperative shell**: pure builders turn pydantic params into wire payloads, and
thin HTTP clients send them. The two backends' APIs are shaped very differently, which is the main thing to
understand.

### Shared, backend-agnostic layer: `api/shared_data/`

- `diffusion_params.py`: `DiffusionParams`, the pydantic base holding parameters common to both backends. Each backend
  **subclasses** it: `DiffusionRequestBody` (WebUI) and `ComfyUIDiffusionParams` add backend-specific fields.
- `api_datatypes.py`: `DiffusionUpscalingParams` and related shared models.
- `generation_handle.py`: the backend-agnostic async generation handle both clients implement.
- `controlnet/`: `ControlNetUnit` + `ControlNetModel` + `ControlNetPreprocessor`, all backend-agnostic. Units are
  attached to `diffusion_params.controlnet_units`; each backend serializes them into its own form. Serialization
  round-trips are pinned by `tests/unit/test_controlnet_serialization.py`.

### `api/webservice.py`: `WebService` base

Session/auth/GET/POST helper both clients extend. On a 401 it calls `_handle_auth_error()` (subclass-overridden), then
retries the request. `A1111Webservice` implements it via a `credentials_provider` callback; ComfyUI has no auth.

### WebUI client: `api/a1111_webservice.py` + `api/webui/` (synchronous)

`A1111Webservice.txt2img(body)` / `img2img(image, mask, body)` block until the image is ready and return
`{'images': list[PIL.Image], 'info': ...}`. `api/webui/` holds the request/response pydantic formats.
`DiffusionRequestBody.to_dict()` (`webui/diffusion_request_body.py`) strips `None`s and is where ControlNet units get
injected into `alwayson_scripts`.

### ComfyUI client: `api/comfyui_webservice.py` + `api/comfyui/` (asynchronous, node graphs)

ComfyUI is a queue: `ComfyUiWebservice.txt2img(params)` returns immediately with a `prompt_id`; callers poll
`check_queue_entry(prompt_id)` until FINISHED, then call `download_images(...)`. `submit_*` wraps this in a
`ComfyGenerationHandle`, which reads step progress and previews from the server websocket through the service's one
`ComfyProgressListener` (`comfyui/comfyui_progress_listener.py`).

The request body is a **node graph**, not JSON fields. This is the most involved part of the repo:

- `comfyui/diffusion_workflow_builder.py`: `DiffusionWorkflowBuilder`. Configure it by setting attributes, then
  `build_workflow()` returns a `ComfyNodeGraph`. It decides checkpoint/KSampler wiring, prompt encoding,
  txt2img-vs-img2img latent source, CLIP-skip insertion, batching, etc. Its graph structure is pinned by
  `tests/unit/test_comfy_workflow_builder.py`.
- `comfyui/nodes/`: one class per ComfyUI node type (`ComfyNode` subclasses), grouped into `input/`, `vae/`,
  `model_extensions/`, `controlnet/`. Each node declares its valid input keys and output count.
  `nodes/comfy_node_graph.py` (`ComfyNodeGraph`) assigns integer string keys, wires connections as
  `(node_key, output_slot)` tuples, and emits the final `{key: {class_type, inputs}}` workflow dict. Node keys start
  at 3, and both `ComfyNode` and `ComfyNodeGraph` implement `__deepcopy__` because builders clone partial graphs.
- Separate builders exist for upscaling and preprocessor-preview workflows (`basic_upscale_workflow_builder.py`,
  `latent_upscale_workflow_builder.py`, `preprocessor_preview_workflow_builder.py`).

### `util/`

`geometry.py` (`Size`), `api_defaults.py` (defaults shared by the parameter models), and `visual/image_utils.py`
(base64/PNG to and from `PIL.Image`, RGBA normalization).

## Conventions

- **No Qt / PySide6, no cv2 / numpy.** Images are plain `PIL.Image` (normalized to RGBA); sizes use the minimal `Size`
  class in `util/geometry.py`. The package carries no UI strings or translation helpers.
- **No config layer.** Generation parameters are passed explicitly as pydantic models, never read from a
  `Cache`/`AppConfig` singleton. A new parameter is threaded through the pydantic model.
- **Code runs on Python 3.11,** the `requires-python` minimum CI tests. Two 3.12-only forms break it:
  - the `type X = ...` statement. Write `X: TypeAlias = ...`.
  - `typing.TypedDict` in anything pydantic validates. Import `TypedDict` from `typing_extensions`.
- **Errors use the tree in `sd_backend_client/errors.py`.** A failure talking to a backend raises an `SDBackendError`
  subclass, invalid caller input raises `ValueError`, and `assert` only guards internal invariants, since `python -O`
  strips it.
- **Ask the maintainer before adding a dependency,** and keep them minimal. Every runtime dependency lands in each
  library user's environment.
- Match the surrounding code's style, naming, and structure.
- **A bug found during unrelated work gets fixed or filed, never just noticed.**
  - Trivial to fix (a wrong assertion, an off-by-one, a stale comment or pointer): fix it in the same pass.
  - Needs real investigation or design, or touches code you weren't already changing: open a GitHub issue (see
    "Tracking open work") with what was observed, how to reproduce it, and what is ruled out.
  - "Trivial" is about the fix, not the effort spent finding it. A fix that needs a manual check against a live
    backend, a new test harness, or more than one full test run to confirm belongs in an issue, unless the maintainer
    asked for that investigation.

## Comments and docs

**Comments are reference, not advocacy.** A comment tells the next reader what is true of the code as it stands,
quickly. It does not defend a design to a skeptic or argue against the version it replaced. These rules apply to
comments and docstrings you write or touch, to this file, and to new markdown docs. Existing human-written comments
don't need rewriting to conform, and nothing enforces these rules mechanically.

- **Lead with the rule.** The first line of a comment or docstring is a standalone summary; a reader who stops there
  must lose no invariant.
- **One fact, one home.** State a fact fully where the thing is defined. Elsewhere, point or stay silent. A pointer
  names a symbol or a section title, never a position ("see `DiffusionWorkflowBuilder.build_workflow`", not "see the
  comment above"), and it must resolve: check every "see X" before committing.
- **Pin to a declaration, not a region.** One comment describes one thing below it. Split a paragraph that describes
  several things and re-attach each piece, so each moves with its code.
- **Keep hazards, drop ghosts.**
  - A hazard warns that a change here breaks something there. Keep it, as the main clause.
  - A ghost is prose about a design the code doesn't have: an argument against an alternative ("rather than X") or a
    note about a prior state ("X used to live in Y"). Do that reasoning in your head, not the file.
  - Keep a history note only where a reader would otherwise trip: a redirect, a permanent alias, a link that still
    uses an old name. Where this package diverges from the IntraPaint code it was extracted from, saying so counts.
  - Before finishing, sweep the lines you touched for "used to", "instead of", "rather than", "no longer",
    "anymore", "previously", "now". Most hits are ghosts.
- **Length tracks risk.** A few lines is the default. More is earned only where deleting a clause would let a careful
  reader introduce a real bug. Never delete a hazard to look terse; condense or relocate it.
- **No color.** Leave out measurements, incident narrative and closed issue numbers unless the reader needs them to
  act. Cite an issue only when it is open and the reader should follow it.
- **Plain declaratives.** No shouting caps or conviction words ("exactly", "really", "deliberately", "on purpose").
  One clause per sentence, real lists for list-shaped content, and symbols rather than their current values.
- **Module docstrings say what the file is for** and which decision it embodies. Match the surrounding comment
  density, and don't narrate what the code does line by line.
- **ASCII hyphens, not em dashes,** in comments and markdown.

## Testing

- **`tests/unit/` is the safety net CI runs.** It is offline and deterministic and covers the request-shaping logic.
  A change that silently alters an emitted request must fail there, not only in a live generation, so a builder or
  serialization change comes with a unit test.
- **Integration tests live at the top of `tests/`** and talk to real backends. `tests/conftest.py`'s fixtures skip
  them when the backend is unreachable, auth or ControlNet is absent, or the `--run-generation` flag is off. CI has
  no backend, so it runs none of them: changes to the HTTP clients need a local run against a live server.
- The ControlNet generation integration tests contain a **silent-failure detector**: they generate the same
  seed+prompt with and without a control unit and fail unless the outputs differ. Keep that invariant in mind when
  touching ControlNet serialization.
- Generation tests save PNGs to `SD_TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` (default `tests/output/`, gitignored). Write any other test
  output to a temporary directory, never the working tree.
- **Prevent flaky tests instead of quarantining them.**
  - Unit tests don't touch the network, a backend, or wall-clock time.
  - No retry markers. Beyond the conftest skips above, the only allowed markers are `skip`, with a reason and an
    issue link, and `xfail(strict=True)`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request into `main` and every push to it: `pytest tests/` on
  Python 3.11-3.14 and once more on 3.11 with the oldest allowed runtime dependencies, plus the lint and type checks
  below. Its `ci` job is the single check to require for merging.
- **The test job fails when line-and-branch coverage drops below its `--cov-fail-under` floor** in `ci.yml`. New code
  comes with unit tests that keep it above the floor; raise the floor when coverage rises, and don't lower it to land
  a change.

## Type checking

`mypy` (no arguments, configured in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.mypy]`) is CI's type-check gate. It runs with mypy's
default, non-strict settings, and the package must pass it with zero errors.

- **Strictness is opt-in per module,** through `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` sections. Don't turn on a strict flag
  globally: improving typing is welcome but not a priority, and work shouldn't block on it.

- **Loose data gets an honest type.** Where data is loose by design (parsed JSON, backend API responses, ComfyUI node
  inputs), type it as loosely as it is (`Any`, `object`, a partial `TypedDict`) until there is a real type to write.
  A strict type that fights the code's actual tolerance, a `cast` that asserts something unchecked, or a
  `# type: ignore` that hides a real mismatch is worse than a loose type.

## Lint

`scripts/pylint.sh` shows the full report (uses `.pylintrc`). Keep new code clean against it.

`python scripts/pylint_check.py` is CI's lint gate. The code isn't pylint-clean yet, so it fails only when a file
gains messages beyond `scripts/pylint_baseline.json`, or when fixed messages leave the baseline too high. After fixing
messages, rerun it with `--update-baseline` and commit the baseline. Run it with Python 3.13: the baseline is only
valid for the version it was generated with.

## Git & releases

- **Hard rule:** `main` is the development and release branch. Changes only reach it via PR. Branch from `main` and
  target PRs at it.
- **release-please owns the version and the changelog.** `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` describes the release
  flow. Don't edit `pyproject.toml`'s `version`, `.release-please-manifest.json` or existing `CHANGELOG.md` entries
  by hand outside its release PR.

## Working with GitHub

- **Answer a question before changing anything.** A message asking whether, which or how gets its answer and then a
  stop. Reading code to form the answer is fine; edits, commits and PRs wait for a go-ahead. A message that both asks
  and directs gets the answer first, and the work proceeds only if the answer leaves the plan unchanged.
- **Open a PR against `main` once work is complete and checked, without waiting to be asked.** This overrides a coding
  agent's default of only opening a PR on explicit request. Run `pytest tests/`, `scripts/pylint_check.py` and `mypy`
  first. Agents may also commit and push to their working branch and create issues without asking.
- **PR titles use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:** `type: summary`, with a type
  such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci` or `chore`, and an optional scope
  (`fix(comfyui): ...`). Mark a change that breaks the public API with `!` (`feat!: ...`). PRs into `main` are
  squash-merged, so the title becomes the commit release-please turns into a changelog entry and version bump (`feat`,
  `fix` and `perf` appear in the changelog). Describe the change from a library user's or contributor's point of view.
- **A PR closing an issue says `Closes #NN` in its description.**
- **Don't ask whether to subscribe to a PR you just opened.** If the maintainer wants it watched, they'll say so.
- **An issue or comment an AI agent writes under the maintainer's account ends with a footer marking it as
  AI-generated**, e.g. `_Drafted with AI assistance._`, so it doesn't read as the maintainer arguing with themselves.
  Keep it tool-agnostic ("AI assistance", never a product name), since the maintainer uses more than one agent.
- **An issue links a repo document by permalink, not by branch path.** Use a blob url pinned to a commit sha, with the
  section's heading anchor (`.../blob/<sha>/tests/README.md#...`), so the link still shows what the issue was written
  against after the doc is edited, renamed or deleted. Code references by symbol name stay as they are.

## Tracking open work

- **Open work lives only in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/centuryglass/sd-backend-client/issues).** Nothing in the
  repo tracks tasks.
- **A found bug that isn't a same-pass fix opens an issue**: what was observed, how to reproduce it, and what is ruled
  out.
- **A fact worth knowing is not a task.** It belongs in the owning module's comment, or here.
- **Open issues are usually already in context.** The `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`) runs
  `scripts/issues.py`, which writes `.claude/cache/issues/` (`index.md` plus one file per issue) and prints the index.
  The cache is generated and gitignored; never edit it or treat it as the source of truth. `scripts/issues.py`'s
  docstring covers the fetch paths and `SD_API_ISSUES_TOKEN`.
- **When the hook produced nothing** (rate-limited, no token, or an agent that doesn't run Claude Code hooks), build
  the cache by hand before concluding no issue covers something: fetch the issue list with whatever tool you have
  (the GitHub MCP `list_issues`, `gh issue list --json ...`), save it as JSON, run
  `python3 scripts/issues.py --from-json <path>`, then read `.claude/cache/issues/index.md`.

## Cloud sessions

`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` refreshes the issue cache in every session (see "Tracking open work"). At the start
of a Claude Code on the web session it also creates `.venv` with Python 3.13, installs `requirements-dev.txt` and the
package in editable mode, and puts `.venv/bin` first on `PATH`, so `pytest`, `scripts/pylint_check.py` and `mypy` work
without further setup.
